	  <p>The Wen — a still-twitching carcass of a city that hasn’t yet realized it’s already dead. A population
	     forever laboring beneath the dead weight of thnies. All that remains is meat. Bodies are
	     grafted-together pieces of shit that solely serve as meat-machines rm labor. It doesn’t matter
	     anymore who you are. Nothing matters. The system never changes, onds more. For meat is aall is meat.
	     Will you be the one to kill this cancerous cyst of a city? Or will you join everyone else in submission and death?
