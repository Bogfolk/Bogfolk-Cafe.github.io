		<p>The Wen — a still-twitching carcass of a city that hasn’t yet realized it’s already dead. A
			population
			forever laboring beneath the dead weight of the Companies. All that remains is meat. Bodies are
			grafted-together pieces of shit that solely serve as meat-machines to perform labor. It doesn’t
			matter
			anymore who you are. Nothing matters. The system never changes, only demands more. For meat is
			all, and all is meat.
			Will you be the one to kill this cancerous cyst of a city? Or will you join everyone else in
			submission and death?
