    <h3>FOR MEAT IS ALL</h3>
    <p>The Wen — a still-twitching carcass of a city that hasn’t yet realized it’s already dead. A population
      forever laboring beneath the dead weight of the Companies. All that remains is meat. Bodies are
      grafted-together pieces of shit that solely serve as meat-machines to perform labor. It doesn’t matter
      anymore who you are. Nothing matters. The system never changes, only demands more. For meat is all,
      and all is meat.
    </p>

      Will you be the one to kill this cancerous cyst of a city? Or will you join everyone else in submission and death?

  <h3>THE MEAT</h3>
  <p>
    Lichoma is an explicitly political RPG in a dystopian setting defined by ecological
    collapse, social strife, and body-based economics and technology. PCs carry out
    missions for and against the various factions and controlling Companies. They’re
    rewarded with new body parts that players can use to modify their characters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although based on their cards, characepts and abilities are otherwise freeform
    and interpretive, not bound hard and fast by classes or mechanics. In a world
    where flesh is endlessly mutable, characters can be and do whatever the cards and
    background inspire in the player.
  </p>
  <p>
    This creative aspect is complemented by an intuitive, streamlined system. The core
    rules fit on a single card and include fast procedures for non-combat Challenges
    and violent Conflicts that can move seamlessly from one-on-one matchups to massive
    brawls. Additional, optional rules allow groups to add more depth and nuance to fit
    their table’s preferred play style.

  <p><b>Metastasis</b> takes players deeper into the Wen by providing new adventures, locations, NPCs, mechanics, and

  <p><b>Firestarter</b> greatly expands on the Wildfires, Lichoma’s anarchic seventh faction, allowing players to fight
    to defend the status quo or else burn it to the fucking ground.
