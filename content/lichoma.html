  <h3>FOR MEAT IS ALL</h3>
  <p>The Wen — a still-twitching carcass of a city that hasn’t yet realized it’s already dead. A population
    forever laboring beneath the dead weige Companies. All that remains is meat. Bodies are
    grafted-together pieces of shit that solely serve as meat-machines to perform labor. It doesn’t matter
    anymore who you are. Nothing matters. Thenever changes, only demands more. For meat is all,
    and all is meat.

    Will you be the one to kill this cancerous cyst of a city? Or will you join everyone else in submission and death?

  <h3>THE MEAT</h3>
  <p>
  Lichoma is an explicitly political RPG in a dystopian setting defined by ecological
  collapse, social strife, and body-based economics and technology. PCs carry out
  missions for and against the various factions and controlling Companies. They’re
  rewarded with new body parts that players can use to modify their characters.
  </p>
  <p>
  Although based on their cards, characepts and abilities are otherwise freeform
  and interpretive, not bound hard and fast by classes or mechanics. In a world
  where flesh is endlessly mutable, characters can be and do whatever the cards and
  background inspire in the player.
  </p>
  <p>
  This creative aspect is complemented by an intuitive, streamlined system. The core
  rules fit on a single card and include fast procedures for non-combat Challenges
  and violent Conflicts that can move seamlessly from one-on-one matchups to massive
  brawls. Additional, optional rules allow groups to add more depth and nuance to fit
  their table’s preferred play style.
